    "Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.\n",

    "We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.\n",

    "    - I would find & replace the non-alphanumerics characters from the string with regex and make lowercase hold it in a variable\n",
    "    - then compare the that string with another reverse string made by Array.from(payloadString).reverse().join(\")\n",
    "    - And that's a wrap up.\n"
